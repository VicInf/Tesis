Versions history :
___Version 2.0.0 (September 2022) Palettes Update : compatibility fix with TopDownEngine Unity Package (switch "Color Mode" from "Gamma" to "Linear").
                                      Simplify the number of tile palette to only keep "SuperRetro_TilePalette", "SuperRetro_AutotilePalette" and "SuperRetro_LegacytilePalette" (no more versionned)
                                            > Add stacked trees tiles to "SuperRetro_TilePalette"
                                      Move legacy tiles to "SuperRetro_LegacytilePalette"
                                      Direct integration of Fang package (v2.1.0) so there is no more unity asset store dependency to download
                                            > Fix integrated Fang package to clear remaining console errors
                                                > comment "public class FangAutoTilePreview : ObjectPreview" class
                                                > comment "public override Texture2D RenderStaticPreview" method
